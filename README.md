# Ecosystem Diagram

This ecosystem diagram was built to showcase my web design & development skills. 
It was built in a little over 6 hours using Next, React, Tailwind and React Three Fiber.

## Why did I use this tech stack?

The short answer is: this is how modern web apps are built. For the purposes of this exercise, I could have used plain vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. However, that wouldn't really showcase how we address the challenges we encounter in our day-to-day work.

There's a reason this tech stack is the most widely adopted:

- Next.js addresses routing, SEO, rendering (client-side and server-side), styling, offers TypeScript support (which, although I'm not a fan of, is favored by many), and provides other valuable optimizations.

- React enables us to build UIs quickly and supports what I believe will be crucial: creating and maintaining a library of reusable components. This becomes particularly important when you're working on one- or two-week sprints to develop websites, as well as when utilizing existing UI libraries.
- I've chosen Tailwind as my CSS framework. I've grown to appreciate its declarative style. It also boasts a strong community and a wide range of components. I've incorporated some components from Flowbite, which, while not perfect, saved me some valuable time. One notable feature is that they provide Figma files for their components as well.
- Last but not least, Three.js. Originally, I set out to accomplish this using D3, but I believed I could take it a step further. When it comes to data visualization, I prefer to work in 3D. It's much more interactive, and Three.js provides a powerful toolkit for this purpose. I should note that I did not do the 3D modeling: these were taken from Sketchfab.
